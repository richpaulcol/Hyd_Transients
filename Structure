The aim of this repo is to reorganise the program for calculating the hydraulic transients in water pipe systems.

I will be aiming to use the structures of the epanet-dev to aid the ease of development of the program and to ensure that the it can be easily extended.

There will be many ToDo's

The structure will be something like the following:
    = Core
